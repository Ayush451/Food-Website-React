# Food-Website-React

I have created this website mainly to apply my react skills which I have learnt so far. 

In order to run this application you need do the following:
(please ensure you have node install in your computer)

1) Clone the repository.
2) Use terminal to navigate thru repository. (cd & ls terminal command line)
3) While in the repository run the command "npm start"
4) The Project should run in a localhost :)

<b>What I have used in this application </b>
1) React library (states, props, useState, useEffects, onclick functions)
2) SCSS for the styling and animation (custom variables, css styling, styling for each section)
